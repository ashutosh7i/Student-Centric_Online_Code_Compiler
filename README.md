# Student-Centric Online Code Compiler
(College Minor Project)

**Idea**: This project aims to create a centralized online coding platform tailored for educational institutions. It addresses the challenges of diverse compiler setups, slow performance, and data loss in college labs. Our goal is to simplify coding tasks for both students and educators

**Technologies**:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ChakraUI.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.
- **Compilation**: Native Compiler for languages.
- **Databases**: MySQL (user management) & MongoDB (code management).
- **Hosting**: NGINX & Local network for college-wide access.
- **Authentication**: OAuth / Google Workspace Login.

**Planned Applications**:
1. **Educational Institutions**:
   - Streamlined coding environment for students and teachers.
2. **Hackathons and Competitions**:
   - Consistent coding environments for competitions.
3. **Corporate Training**:
   - Coding platform for employee training.
4. **Open Source Projects**:
   - Collaborative coding environment for open-source communities.

**Features**:
- Centralized Platform: Local Network Hosted (offline available).
- Multi-Language Support: Access to various programming languages.
- Real-Time Code Saving: Seamless continuation across labs.
- Interactive Console: Effortless input and output.
- Monitoring System: Educators can track and guide.
- Strong Assessments: Offline test hosting.
